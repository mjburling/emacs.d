### my emacs config

this emacs setting is full compatible Linux and Mac Os

### install packages

`cask install`

if you have problem to install pallet

`Dependency pallet failed to install: Package `package-build-0.1' is unavailable`

you have to remove (source melpa-sable) by (source melpa)

### clojure development with cider

its better to install cider from `melpa-stable`.

`cask install cider`
